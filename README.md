# Pinetwork-
This group is all about  pi network  ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ *Food for thought.*   Pls let us learn from past experience. When Bitcoin started people neglected it, they said all sorts of things against it. What is their reason for doing that? Their reason for doing that is just because Bitcoin mining is free. They now ask how can I make money from free something? But today the good news about Bitcoin is that is Digital Gold, 1 Bitcoin is now sold at $67,000 check the worth in your local currency. Remember Bitcoin mining lasted for about 2 years before lunching it for use. The same thing is happening to Pi network free crypto currency now, time shall come when you will say had I known, and that time those who mine the Pi coin seriously, will answer you, "who knows tomorrow". Mine your Pi now while you can. But remember Pi network is going life this year,  who knows the value............., maybe $1, $10, $100, &amp; $1000 per Pi coin think about it, think about it. Please make good use of every opportunity is worthwhile.
